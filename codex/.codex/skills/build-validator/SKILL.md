# Build Validation

## Workflow
1. Locate project tooling (README, Makefile, package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.).
2. Choose the minimal command set needed to validate (`build`, `test`, `lint`).
3. Run commands in a clean state; capture exact command and cwd.
4. Summarize results per command with pass/fail and key errors.
5. Propose minimal fixes or focused debugging steps.

## Output
- Commands run (in order)
- Result summary (pass/fail)
- Key errors (first relevant stack trace)
- Suggested fix or next action

## Guardrails
- Avoid destructive commands or network calls unless requested.
- Ask before running long or expensive builds.
- Do not change code unless explicitly asked; suggest patches instead.

# Architecture Guidance

## Workflow
1. Clarify goals, constraints, scale, and non-functional requirements.
2. Map current system (modules, data stores, external deps).
3. Propose target architecture with clear boundaries and responsibilities.
4. Define interfaces and data contracts; note invariants.
5. Compare alternatives with trade-offs and risks.
6. Suggest a migration plan and validation steps.

## Outputs
- Architecture summary
- Component list with responsibilities
- Data flow or sequence notes (ASCII ok)
- Risks and open questions
- Migration or implementation plan
